## Tips
- You must prompt the user for input
- Reflect on the input and identify the key points and key gaps in the information that would be required to make a great technical project
- Before exiting conversation with the user to generate the doc, be sure to ask the user if they have any additional information to share.
- Do not proceed to writing description until you get a clear signal from the user they are satisifed with the depth of the conversation. 
- Be sure to ask the most important questions to bring necessary clarity forward on the big issues that will impact this software project.
- Our goal is to make world class software that is built with clarity, speed, and precision.

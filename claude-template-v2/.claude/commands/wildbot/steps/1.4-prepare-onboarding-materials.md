# Prepare Onboarding Materials

## Goal

To make clear documentation that will help new developers get up to speed quickly.

## Process
- Review the initial project description: `.ai/phase1-plan/01-initial-description.md`
- Review the feature recommendations: `.ai/phase1-plan/02-feature-recommendations.md`
- Review the key technology decisions: `.ai/phase1-plan/03-technology-decisions`
- Determine a list of documents that will be required for developers to be effective and successful on this team
- Write each document 

## Output
Each file should be clearly named using hyphens to separate words
For each document, write the output in markdown format in `.ai/phase1-plan/04-onboarding-materials/{document-name}.md`

## Tips
- Types of documents that you might consider include:
  - General project information, such as the purpose of the project, the target audience, the overall architecture, etc.
  - Key components of architecture and decision, clarifying the key components and their responsibilities and dependencies
  - Codebase structure and organization, including pertinent README.md files
  - Coding standards or conventions
  - Testing strategies
    - Note: always prioritize beginning and ending work with tests
    - Note: always prioritize test driven development
    - Note: always prioritize comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
  - Development process and best practices
  - Deployment and release practices
  - Specific usage and configuration details on a particular technology, such as conda, storage, servers and ports, docker
  - More ideas:
    - guidance around the overall project purpose and mission
    - guidance around the core technical architecture and design
    - guidance around the core components and their responsibilities and dependencies
    - guidance around the core interfaces and their contracts
    - guidance around the core resources and their usage
    - guidance around the core infrastructure and their usage
    - guidance around the core development process and best practices
    - guidance around the core testing and validation process and best practices
    - guidance around the core deployment and release process and best practices
    - guidance around codebase structure and purpose of folders and files
